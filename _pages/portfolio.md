My research develops biologically-inspired frameworks that enhance the robustness and adaptability of artificial neural networks. I have demonstrated the practical relevance of these approaches across diverse domains, including molecular property prediction, biomedical classification, and graph-structured data analysis. These applications are enabled by architectures that integrate homeostatic regulation, multi-scale temporal coordination, and self-repair mechanisms, thereby achieving stable, resilient, and biologically-faithful artificial intelligence systems that maintain reliable performance under perturbation and environmental variability.
