Welcome to my portfolio section. Here you can find details about various projects I have undertaken in the fields of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. My work spans both competitive platforms like Kaggle and practical applications showcased on GitHub.

## Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects

For a comprehensive overview of my projects focused specifically on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, including various data analysis tasks, model building, and participation in competitions, I invite you to visit my Kaggle profile. Kaggle serves as a platform where I actively engage with complex datasets and refine my skills in predictive modeling and data science.

You can explore my notebooks, competition entries, and datasets here:

## Artificial Intelligence Projects

My work in Artificial Intelligence extends to developing unique, application-focused solutions. Below are some examples of AI projects I have developed, demonstrating the practical application of AI techniques to solve specific problems. For detailed code implementation and further exploration, please refer to my GitHub repository.

*   **AI-Driven Tourist Spot Finder:** This project utilizes AI algorithms to analyze user preferences, location data, and historical trends to recommend personalized tourist destinations. It aims to enhance the travel planning experience by providing tailored suggestions.
*   **Food Recommendation Based on Health Condition:** Leveraging AI, this system analyzes individual health data and dietary requirements to suggest suitable food options. It is designed to assist users in making informed nutritional choices aligned with their specific health conditions.
*   **Bengali Text-to-Speech Synthesis:** This project involved fine-tuning the Pegasus model, a transformer-based architecture, to create a high-quality text-to-speech system specifically for the Bengali language. It addresses the need for better accessibility and interaction tools for Bengali speakers.
