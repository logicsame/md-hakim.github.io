### Experience

**Owner and AI/ML/DL Project Researcher, AI Project Solution**
*(Jan 2024 - Present)*

In my role at AI Project Solution, I have led and delivered more than 30 AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning projects. I provide tailored solutions encompassing machine learning model development, deep learning applications, and comprehensive MLOps strategies for a diverse range of clients. A significant part of my work involves implementing robust end-to-end MLOps pipelines, incorporating automation, meticulous model tracking, and streamlined deployment using tools like MLflow and Git Actions. These practices have demonstrably improved project efficiency by approximately 40%. My specialization includes model optimization, rigorous experiment management, and deploying models into production environments, which has resulted in an average improvement of 25% in model performance across various projects. Additionally, I actively contribute to knowledge sharing by conducting workshops and training sessions focused on AI/ML technologies, having upskilled over 100 professionals in the field.

### Key Projects

My project portfolio demonstrates a wide range of applications and technical depth:

*   **Image Colorization using MLOps:** Developed and automated an image colorization pipeline, leveraging MLOps principles for continuous model deployment and version control, achieving 98% accuracy in color prediction.
*   **Speech to Text from Scratch:** Engineered a custom deep learning-based speech-to-text system, including an efficient pipeline for data preprocessing and model training, which reduced the error rate by 30% compared to standard off-the-shelf solutions.
*   **Food Recommendation System using OCR and Generative AI:** Created an innovative food recommendation system that integrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology with generative AI, leading to a high user satisfaction rate of 95%.
*   **Agricultural Yield Prediction using Federated Learning:** Constructed a federated learning model designed for agricultural yield prediction, successfully maintaining data privacy across distributed datasets while improving prediction accuracy by 20%.
*   **Bengali Next Word Prediction:** Developed a sophisticated Bengali next-word prediction model using deep learning techniques, trained on extensive Bengali language datasets, achieving 85% accuracy in predicting contextually relevant words.
*   **Pegasus Model Retraining for Bengali:** Retrained the Pegasus transformer model specifically for Bengali text, incorporating a custom tokenizer. This significantly enhanced performance for Bengali language summarization tasks by 40%.
*   **Bengali-English Machine Translation:** Built a transformer-based machine translation system for both Bengali-to-English and English-to-Bengali translation directions. This involved creating a custom dataset of 30 million sentence pairs and resulted in superior translation accuracy and fluency compared to existing models.
*   **Multimodal Emotion Detection using Explainable AI:** Implemented a system for detecting emotions using multimodal data (audio, video, text) from the CMU-MOSI dataset. Crucially, this project integrated Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret model decisions, thereby enhancing transparency and trustworthiness.
*   **Welding Machine Tool Breakage Detection:** Developed an unsupervised learning model capable of detecting tool breakage times in welding machines solely based on audio data. This system improves predictive maintenance schedules and significantly reduces operational downtime by accurately identifying potential breakage events.
