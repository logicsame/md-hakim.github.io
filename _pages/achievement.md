This section highlights significant recognitions and accomplishments achieved throughout my academic and professional journey in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

## AI Agent Competition Success

I am proud to have secured the **2nd Runner-Up** position in a highly competitive AI agent development competition. This event, organized by the Intent Company in collaboration with the International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC), attracted significant participation from across Bangladesh.

The competition featured over 200 teams representing some of the nation's top-tier universities, including prominent institutions such as Dhaka University of Engineering & Technology (DUET), Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET), and Dhaka University. Achieving a top-three placement amidst such a talented and diverse field underscores my capabilities in designing and implementing effective AI agents capable of tackling complex challenges.

This accomplishment reflects not only technical proficiency in AI development but also strategic thinking and problem-solving skills under competitive pressure. It serves as a testament to my dedication to excelling in the dynamic and rapidly evolving domain of Artificial Intelligence.
