## About Myself

I am MD Azizul Hakim, a dedicated professional deeply involved in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. My journey in AI began formally in 2023 when I took on the role of an AI, ML, and DL Researcher at AI Project Solution. In this capacity, I focus on exploring and advancing the frontiers of intelligent systems. Concurrently, I serve as an AI, ML, and DL Engineer, translating theoretical concepts into tangible applications, and also function as an MLOps Engineer, ensuring that these sophisticated models are deployed, monitored, and maintained efficiently in production environments. My passion lies in bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world impact, creating AI solutions that are not only innovative but also robust and scalable.

## Breaking New Ground in AI Research

My current research endeavors are centered on developing a **self-repairing biological deep learning algorithm featuring homeostatic regulation**. This pioneering approach has demonstrated superior performance on critical biomedical datasets, including those related to AIDS, HIV, COX2, and protein analysis. The potential applications of this innovation are vast, particularly within pharmaceutical and biological research, as well as in enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI agents, and general AI systems.

## Research Expertise & Current Focus

My research expertise spans various advanced AI paradigms. I am currently focused on integrating complementary technologies to build powerful, application-ready systems. Key areas include:

### LLM Innovation
Developing context-aware fine-tuning techniques, researching efficient transformer architectures, creating novel prompt engineering frameworks, and implementing biological principles to enhance LLM stability.

### AI Agent Architecture
Designing autonomous agents with advanced planning, multi-modal perception, self-repair mechanisms, and robust evaluation frameworks.

### General AI Agent Systems
Building integrated platforms combining LLMs, computer vision, and reinforcement learning, researching multi-agent collaboration, developing cross-domain knowledge transfer, and creating benchmarks for general AI capabilities.

### Combined Technology Applications
I am actively pioneering applications that merge these research areas, focusing on healthcare diagnostics, intelligent manufacturing, personalized education, and environmental monitoring.
