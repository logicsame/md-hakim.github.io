## Bio

I am a researcher specializing in biologically-inspired artificial intelligence and robust neural network architectures. My work bridges neuroscience principles with machine learning, focusing on developing systems that exhibit the stability and resilience characteristic of biological intelligence.
I approach research with commitment to both theoretical rigor and practical impact, developing methods that are grounded in biological principles while addressing fundamental limitations in current artificial neural networks.

## Research Interests
My research program centers on creating artificial intelligence systems that embody principles of biological robustness and adaptability:

### Biologically-Inspired Neural Architectures
Developing neural network layers and systems that incorporate homeostatic regulation, self-repair mechanisms, and multi-scale temporal dynamics inspired by biological nervous systems.

### Robust and Resilient AI Systems
Addressing the brittleness of artificial neural networks through bio-inspired stability mechanisms that enable consistent performance under perturbations, distribution shifts, and adverse conditions.

### Multi-Scale Temporal Coordination
Investigating how coordination across multiple temporal scales—from milliseconds to hours—can enhance the efficiency, stability, and recovery capabilities of artificial neural systems.

### Neuromorphic and Brain-Inspired Computing
Translating principles from neuroscience and evolutionary biology into computational frameworks that advance the capabilities of artificial intelligence.

### General AI Agent Systems
Building integrated platforms combining LLMs, computer vision, and researching multi-agent collaboration, developing cross-domain knowledge transfer, and creating benchmarks for general AI capabilities.

### Combined Technology Applications
I am actively pioneering applications that merge these research areas, focusing on healthcare diagnostics, intelligent manufacturing, personalized education, and environmental monitoring.
