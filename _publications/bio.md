**Abstract:**

In the rapidly advancing realm of artificial intelligence, bridging biological processes with computational models has become a pivotal strategy for enhancing robustness and adaptability in neural networks. This paper introduces and evaluates a biologically inspired neural network layer—termed BioLogicalNeuron—across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST. By incorporating calcium-dependent regulation, homeostatic control, and adaptive repair strategies, the architecture consistently outperforms standard deep learning methods.

**Key Results:**
- **CIFAR-10:** 90.42% accuracy (3.77% improvement over baseline)
- **MNIST:** 99.43% accuracy
- **Fashion-MNIST:** 93.27% accuracy

The BioLogicalNeuron maintains stability metrics above 0.92 through targeted interventions triggered at a repair threshold of 0.8. These findings underscore the transformative potential of biologically-derived computational methodologies in augmenting deep learning architectures for image classification, exemplifying a powerful synthesis of neurobiological insights and computational efficacy.
