This paper presents a pioneering approach to neural network design by incorporating homeostatic regulation and adaptive repair mechanisms inspired by biological nervous systems. The proposed layer architecture demonstrates the ability to maintain stable function and self-repair under perturbations, addressing fundamental brittleness issues in artificial neural networks.

The research validates the approach across critical biomedical datasets including AIDS, HIV, COX2, and protein analysis tasks, showing superior performance compared to conventional architectures. This work establishes a foundation for building more robust and resilient neural networks through biologically-principled design.
